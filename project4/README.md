Program
------------------------------
Write an assembler language program with the following 6 functions:
- Read in up to 10 integer values into an array.  The last value read in will be -9.  Do not include -9 in your array.  Of course, you will need to count how many values you read in (be sure you don't include the -9 in the count).
- Find the sum of values in the array.
- Find the integer average (do not pass sum, have average call sum).
- Find the min value read in
- Find the max value read in
- Count how many values are above the average and below the average.

The main will print out all the results.
