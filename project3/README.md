## Project 3
#### Due Wednesday, Mar. 1

------------------------------

Program
------------------------------
Write an assembler language program with the following 6 sections of code:
- Read in up to 10 integer values into an array.  The last value read in will be -9.  Do not include -9 in your array.  Of course, you will need to count how many values you read in (be sure you don't include the -9 in the count).
- Find the sum of values in the array.(after you have read them in, not while reading them in).
- Find the integer average.
- Find the min value read in (use its own loop)
- Find the max value read in (use its own loop)
- Count how many values are above the average and below the average (using its own loop)

Do each of these as 6 separate steps.  The read section should just do the reading (and counting). Be sure you print
out the results of each.

Extra Credit
------------------------------
Sort the data and find the median (middle value or average of the two middle values if the count is even).

Extra Extra Credit
------------------------------
Find the mode (the most frequently used value).
